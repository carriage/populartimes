Located at the back side of the house, northeast corner. See parking diagram in photo below. Free WiFi while you wait. You can monitor the status of this station at http://bit.ly/MillisEVSE and determine if the charger is in use. Feel free to unplug a vehicle that's done charging.

Technically this is a home charger but I'm listing it as public because you can just pull in and use it any time without calling me first.  Questions? E-mail me at DanWinkler@gmail.com

Details on this charger and the subsidy from Eversouce which helped pay for it are at http://bit.ly/EversourceSubsidy
